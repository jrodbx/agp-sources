/**
 * The {@code ZFile} provides the main interface for interacting with zip files. A {@code ZFile} can
 * be created on a new file or in an existing file. Once created, files can be added or removed from
 * the zip file.
 *
 * <p>Changes in the zip file are always deferred. Any change requested is made in memory and
 * written to disk only when {@link #update()} or {@link #close()} is invoked.
 *
 * <p>Zip files are open initially in read-only mode and will switch to read-write when needed. This
 * is done automatically. Because modifications to the file are done in-memory, the zip file can be
 * manipulated when closed. When invoking {@link #update()} or {@link #close()} the zip file will be
 * reopen and changes will be written. However, the zip file cannot be modified outside the control
 * of {@code ZFile}. So, if a {@code ZFile} is closed, modified outside and then a file is added or
 * removed from the zip file, when reopening the zip file, {@link ZFile} will detect the outside
 * modification and will fail.
 *
 * <p>In memory manipulation means that files added to the zip file are kept in memory until written
 * to disk. This provides much faster operation and allows better zip file allocation (see below).
 * It may, however, increase the memory footprint of the application. When adding large files, if
 * memory consumption is a concern, a call to {@link #update()} will actually write the file to disk
 * and discard the memory buffer. Information about allocation can be obtained from a {@link
 * ByteTracker} that can be given to the file on creation.
 *
 * <p>{@code ZFile} keeps track of allocation inside of the zip file. If a file is deleted, its
 * space is marked as freed and will be reused for an added file if it fits in the space. Allocation
 * of files to empty areas is done using a <em>best fit</em> algorithm. When adding a file, if it
 * doesn't fit in any free area, the zip file will be extended.
 *
 * <p>{@code ZFile} provides a fast way to merge data from another zip file (see {@link
 * #mergeFrom(ZFile, Predicate)}) avoiding recompression and copying of equal files. When merging,
 * patterns of files may be provided that are ignored. This allows handling special files in the
 * merging process, such as files in {@code META-INF}.
 *
 * <p>When adding files to the zip file, unless files are explicitly required to be stored, files
 * will be deflated. However, deflating will not occur if the deflated file is larger then the
 * stored file, <em>e.g.</em> if compression would yield a bigger file. See {@link Compressor} for
 * details on how compression works.
 *
 * <p>Because {@code ZFile} was designed to be used in a build system and not as general-purpose zip
 * utility, it is very strict (and unforgiving) about the zip format and unsupported features.
 *
 * <p>{@code ZFile} supports <em>alignment</em>. Alignment means that file data (not entries -- the
 * local header must be discounted) must start at offsets that are multiple of a number -- the
 * alignment. Alignment is defined by an alignment rules ({@link AlignmentRule} in the {@link
 * ZFileOptions} object used to create the {@link ZFile}.
 *
 * <p>When a file is added to the zip, the alignment rules will be checked and alignment will be
 * honored when positioning the file in the zip. This means that unused spaces in the zip may be
 * generated as a result. However, alignment of existing entries will not be changed.
 *
 * <p>Entries can be realigned individually (see {@link StoredEntry#realign()} or the full zip file
 * may be realigned (see {@link #realign()}). When realigning the full zip entries that are already
 * aligned will not be affected.
 *
 * <p>Because realignment may cause files to move in the zip, realignment is done in-memory meaning
 * that files that need to change location will moved to memory and will only be flushed when either
 * {@link #update()} or {@link #close()} are called.
 *
 * <p>Alignment only applies to filed that are forced to be uncompressed. This is because alignment
 * is used to allow mapping files in the archive directly into memory and compressing defeats the
 * purpose of alignment.
 *
 * <p>Manipulating zip files with {@link ZFile} may yield zip files with empty spaces between files.
 * This happens in two situations: (1) if alignment is required, files may be shifted to conform to
 * the request alignment leaving an empty space before the previous file, and (2) if a file is
 * removed or replaced with a file that does not fit the space it was in. By default, {@link ZFile}
 * does not do any special processing in these situations. Files are indexed by their offsets from
 * the central directory and empty spaces can exist in the zip file.
 *
 * <p>However, it is possible to tell {@link ZFile} to use the extra field in the local header to do
 * cover the empty spaces. This is done by setting {@link
 * ZFileOptions#setCoverEmptySpaceUsingExtraField(boolean)} to {@code true}. This has the advantage
 * of leaving no gaps between entries in the zip, as required by some tools like Oracle's {code jar}
 * tool. However, setting this option will destroy the contents of the file's extra field.
 *
 * <p>Activating {@link ZFileOptions#setCoverEmptySpaceUsingExtraField(boolean)} may lead to
 * <i>virtual files</i> being added to the zip file. Since extra field is limited to 64k, it is not
 * possible to cover any space bigger than that using the extra field. In those cases, <i>virtual
 * files</i> are added to the file. A virtual file is a file that exists in the actual zip data, but
 * is not referenced from the central directory. A zip-compliant utility should ignore these files.
 * However, zip utilities that expect the zip to be a stream, such as Oracle's jar, will find these
 * files instead of considering the zip to be corrupt.
 *
 * <p>{@code ZFile} support sorting zip files. Sorting (done through the {@link #sortZipContents()}
 * method) is a process by which all files are re-read into memory, if not already in memory,
 * removed from the zip and re-added in alphabetical order, respecting alignment rules. So, in
 * general, file {@code b} will come after file {@code a} unless file {@code a} is subject to
 * alignment that forces an empty space before that can be occupied by {@code b}. Sorting can be
 * used to minimize the changes between two zips.
 *
 * <p>Sorting in {@code ZFile} can be done manually or automatically. Manual sorting is done by
 * invoking {@link #sortZipContents()}. Automatic sorting is done by setting the {@link
 * ZFileOptions#getAutoSortFiles()} option when creating the {@code ZFile}. Automatic sorting
 * invokes {@link #sortZipContents()} immediately when doing an {@link #update()} after all
 * extensions have processed the {@link ZFileExtension#beforeUpdate()}. This has the guarantee that
 * files added by extensions will be sorted, something that does not happen if the invocation is
 * sequential, <i>i.e.</i>, {@link #sortZipContents()} called before {@link #update()}. The drawback
 * of automatic sorting is that sorting will happen every time {@link #update()} is called and the
 * file is dirty having a possible penalty in performance.
 *
 * <p>To allow whole-apk signing, the {@code ZFile} allows the central directory location to be
 * offset by a fixed amount. This amount can be set using the {@link #setExtraDirectoryOffset(long)}
 * method. Setting a non-zero value will add extra (unused) space in the zip file before the central
 * directory. This value can be changed at any time and it will force the central directory
 * rewritten when the file is updated or closed.
 *
 * <p>{@code ZFile} provides an extension mechanism to allow objects to register with the file and
 * be notified when changes to the file happen. This should be used to add extra features to the zip
 * file while providing strong decoupling. See {@link ZFileExtension}, {@link
 * ZFile#addZFileExtension(ZFileExtension)} and {@link ZFile#removeZFileExtension(ZFileExtension)}.
 *
 * <p>This class is <strong>not</strong> thread-safe. Neither are any of the classes associated with
 * it in this package, except when otherwise noticed.
