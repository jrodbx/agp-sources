/**
 * List of possible input parameters a Junit engine can consume to run successfully.
 *
 * Each JUnit engine has particular inputs requirements and these must be passed across processes
 * as the JUnit engine runs in a separate VM. Therefore, we cannot just use the Gradle's Provider
 * APIs, plus those JUnit engines can run im multiple build systems.
 *
 * So to express an input requirement in the Android ecosystem, a JUnit engine configuration can
 * use a combination of the ones defined below. In the case of Gradle build system, the Test task
 * will automatically become dependent on the tasks producing the artifacts and the artifacts
 * location will be passed ot the JUnit engine.
 *
 * To express the engine's requirements, the user must add the required inputs using the
 * [JUnitEngineSpec.inputs] collection of [AgpTestSuiteInputParameters]
 *
 * TODO: possibly explore how junit engine could also express their dependencies to avoid users
 * having the manually add those.
 *
 * TODO: Describe how the JUnit engine can retrieve the values at execution time once experimentation
 * concluded.
