/**
 * Base class for tasks that don't use gradle's up-to-date checks.
 *
 * Be careful using this class, strongly prefer extending [NonIncrementalTask].
 *
 * Such tasks always run when in the task graph, and rely on the task implementation to handle
 * up-to-date checks e.g. the external native build tasks, where the underlying external build
 * system handles those checks. Lint does not use this class, as while it is never up-to-date
 * currently as it doesn't model its inputs, it should clean its outputs before running.
 *
 * Unlike [NonIncrementalTask], this task does **not** clean up its outputs before the task is run.
 * This means that the task implementation is responsible for ensuring that the outputs are correct
 * in that case.
