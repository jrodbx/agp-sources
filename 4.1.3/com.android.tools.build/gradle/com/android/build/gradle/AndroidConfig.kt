     * The Android plugin looks for your project's source code and resources in groups of
     * directories called
     * *[source sets](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html#sourcesets)*.
     * Each source set also determines the scope of build outputs that should consume its code and
     * resources. For example, when creating a new project from Android Studio, the IDE creates
     * directories for a `main/` source set that contains the code and resources you want
     * to share between all your build variants.
     *
     * You can then define basic functionality in the `main/` source set, but use
     * product flavor source sets to change only the branding of your app between different clients,
     * or include special permissions and logging functionality to only "debug" versions of your
     * app.
     *
     * The Android plugin expects you to organize files for source set directories a certain way,
     * similar to the `main/` source set. For example, Gradle expects Java class files
     * that are specific to your "debug" build type to be located in the `src/debug/java/`
     *  directory.
     *
     *
     * Gradle provides a useful task to shows you how to organize your files for each build
     * type-, product flavor-, and build variant-specific source set. you can run this task from the
     * command line as follows:
     *
     * `./gradlew sourceSets`
     *
     *
     * The following sample output describes where Gradle expects to find certain files for the
     * "debug" build type:
     *
     * ```
     * ------------------------------------------------------------
     * Project :app
     * ------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * ...
     *
     * debug
     * ----
     * Compile configuration: compile
     * build.gradle name: android.sourceSets.debug
     * Java sources: [app/src/debug/java]
     * Manifest file: app/src/debug/AndroidManifest.xml
     * Android resources: [app/src/debug/res]
     * Assets: [app/src/debug/assets]
     * AIDL sources: [app/src/debug/aidl]
     * RenderScript sources: [app/src/debug/rs]
     * JNI sources: [app/src/debug/jni]
     * JNI libraries: [app/src/debug/jniLibs]
     * Java-style resources: [app/src/debug/resources]
     * ```
     *
     *
     * If you have sources that are not organized into the default source set directories that
     * Gradle expects, as described in the sample output above, you can use the `sourceSet`
     *  block to change where Gradle looks to gather files for each component of a given
     * source set. You don't need to relocate the files; you only need to provide Gradle with the
     * path(s), relative to the module-level `build.gradle` file, where Gradle should
     * expect to find files for each source set component.
     *
     *
     * **Note:** You should specify only static paths whenever possible. Specifying dynamic
     * paths reduces build speed and consistency.
     *
     *
     * The following code sample maps sources from the `app/other/` directory to
     * certain components of the `main` source set and changes the root directory of the
     * `androidTest` source set:
     *
     * ```
     * android {
     * ...
     *     sourceSets {
     *     // Encapsulates configurations for the main source set.
     *         main {
     *             // Changes the directory for Java sources. The default directory is
     *             // 'src/main/java'.
     *             java.srcDirs = ['other/java']
     *
     *             // If you list multiple directories, Gradle uses all of them to collect
     *             // sources. Because Gradle gives these directories equal priority, if
     *             // you define the same resource in more than one directory, you get an
     *             // error when merging resources. The default directory is 'src/main/res'.
     *             res.srcDirs = ['other/res1', 'other/res2']
     *
     *             // Note: You should avoid specifying a directory which is a parent to one
     *             // or more other directories you specify. For example, avoid the following:
     *             // res.srcDirs = ['other/res1', 'other/res1/layouts', 'other/res1/strings']
     *             // You should specify either only the root 'other/res1' directory, or only the
     *             // nested 'other/res1/layouts' and 'other/res1/strings' directories.
     *
     *             // For each source set, you can specify only one Android manifest.
     *             // By default, Android Studio creates a manifest for your main source
     *             // set in the src/main/ directory.

     * Requires the specified NDK version to be used.
     *
     * <p>Use this to specify a fixed NDK version. Without this, each new version of the Android
     * Gradle Plugin will choose a specific version of NDK to use, so upgrading the plugin also
     * means upgrading the NDK. Locking to a specific version can increase repeatability of the
     * build.
     *
     * <pre>
     * android {
     *     // Use a fixed NDK version
     *     ndkVersion '20.1.5948944'
     * }
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p> The required format of the version is <code>major.minor.build</code>. It's not legal to
     * specify less precision.
     * <p> If <code>ndk.dir</code> is specified in <code>local.properties</code> file then the NDK
     * that it points to must match the <code>android.ndkVersion</code>.
     *
     * <p> Prior to Android Gradle Plugin version 3.5, the highest installed version of NDK will
     * be used.
     * <p> In Android Gradle Plugin 3.4, specifying <code>android.ndkVersion</code> was not an
     * error, but the value would be ignored.
     * <p> Prior to Android Gradle Plugin version 3.4, it was illegal to specify
     * <code>android.ndkVersion</code>.
     *
     * <p>For additional information about NDK installation see <a
     * href="https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/install-ndk">Install and configure
     * the NDK</a>.
     *
     * @param version the NDK to use.
