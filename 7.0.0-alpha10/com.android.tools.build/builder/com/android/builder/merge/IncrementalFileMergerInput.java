/**
 * Input for an incremental merge operation (see {@link IncrementalFileMerger#merge(java.util.List,
 * IncrementalFileMergerOutput, IncrementalFileMergerState, Predicate)}.
 *
 * <p>An input represents a relative tree and a set of changed paths. Note that deleted paths are
 * reported in the changes, although they are no longer part of the relative tree because, well,
 * they were deleted :)
 *
 * <p>The input contains <i>both</i> the updated relative files (see {@link #getUpdatedPaths()}) and
 * the current set of relative files (see {@link #getAllPaths()}.
 *
 * <p>Each {@link IncrementalFileMergerInput} is identified by a name and a contains a set of
 * updates on {@link RelativeFile}. These are usually obtained using the methods from {@link
 * com.android.builder.files.IncrementalRelativeFileSets}.
 *
 * <p>The input is responsible for reading input files given their paths to the input. This makes
 * the actual source of the data invisible to the user.
 *
 * <p>Because not all methods are necessarily needed for every merge operation, it is recommended to
 * use {@link LazyIncrementalFileMergerInput} as implementation.
