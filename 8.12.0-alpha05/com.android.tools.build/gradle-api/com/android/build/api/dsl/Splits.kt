 * Options to configure Multiple APKs.

 *
 * If you publish your app to Google Play, you should build and upload an
 * [Android App Bundle](https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle).
 * When you do so, Google Play automatically generates and serves optimized APKs for each userâ€™s
 * device configuration, so they download only the code and resources they need to run your app.
 * This is much simpler than managing multiple APKs manually.
 *
 * If you publish your app to a store that doesn't support the Android App Bundle format, you can
 * publish
 * [multiple APKs](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits.html)
 * manually.
 *
 * The Android Gradle plugin supports generating multiple APKs based on screen density and
 * [Application Binary Interface (ABI)](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis.html),
 * where each APK contains the code and resources required for a given device configuration.
 *
 * You will also need to
 * [assign version codes to each APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits.html#configure-APK-versions)
 * so that you are able to manage updates later.
 *
 * Previously the Android Gradle plugin also supported building 'Configuration APKs' for Instant
 * Apps using this `splits` block, but that has been superseded by the Android App Bundle format.
