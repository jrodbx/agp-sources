/**
 * DSL object for configuring lint options.
 *
 * This block is replaced by the new [Lint] block. Unlike most other renamed blocks the new type is
 * unrelated, to allow for some extra changes, such as removing the 'is' prefix from boolean
 * properties.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * ```
 * android {
 *    lintOptions {
 *          // set to true to turn off analysis progress reporting by lint
 *          quiet true
 *          // if true, stop the gradle build if errors are found
 *          abortOnError false
 *          // set to true to have all release builds run lint on issues with severity=fatal
 *          // and abort the build (controlled by abortOnError above) if fatal issues are found
 *          checkReleaseBuilds true
 *          // if true, only report errors
 *          ignoreWarnings true
 *          // if true, emit full/absolute paths to files with errors (true by default)
 *          absolutePaths true
 *          // if true, check all issues, including those that are off by default
 *          checkAllWarnings true

 *          warningsAsErrors true

 *          disable 'TypographyFractions','TypographyQuotes'
