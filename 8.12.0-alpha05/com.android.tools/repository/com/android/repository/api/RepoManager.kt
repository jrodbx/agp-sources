 * * Register the [SchemaModule]s used to parse the package.xml files and remote repositories used
 *   by this repo using [registerSchemaModule]
 * * If your local repo might contain packages created by a previous system, set a
 *   [FallbackLocalRepoLoader] that can recognize and convert those packages using
 *   [setFallbackLocalRepoLoader].
 * * Add [RepositorySourceProvider]s to provide URLs for remotely-available packages.
 * * If some sources might be in a format used by a previous system, set a
 *   [FallbackRemoteRepoLoader] that can read and convert them.
 *
 * To load the local and remote packages, use [load].
 *
 * TODO: it would be nice if this could be redesigned such that load didn't need to be called
 *   explicitly, or there was a better way to know if packages were or need to be loaded.
 *
 * To use the loaded packages, get a [RepositoryPackages] object from [packages].
