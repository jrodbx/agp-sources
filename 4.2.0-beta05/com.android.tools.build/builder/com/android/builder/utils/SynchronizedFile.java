/**
 * Utility to synchronize access to a file from multiple threads or processes.
 *
 * <p>When multiple threads or processes access the same file, they would require some form of
 * synchronization. This class provides a simple way for the clients to add synchronization
 * capability to a file without having to work with low-level details involving single-process or
 * multi-process locking.
 *
 * <p>Synchronization can take effect for threads within the same process or across different
 * processes. The client can configure this locking scope when constructing a {@code
 * SynchronizedFile}. If the file is never accessed by more than one process at a time, the client
 * should configure the file with {@code SINGLE_PROCESS} locking scope since there will be less
 * synchronization overhead. However, if the file may be accessed by more than one process at a
 * time, the client must configure the file with {@code MULTI_PROCESS} locking scope.
 *
 * <p>In any case, synchronization takes effect only for the same file (i.e., threads/processes
 * accessing different files are not synchronized). Also, the client must access the file via {@code
 * SynchronizedFile}'s API; otherwise, the previous concurrency guarantees will not hold.
 *
 * <p>Two files are considered the same if they refer to the same physical file. There could be
 * multiple instances of {@code SynchronizedFile} for the same physical file, and as long as they
 * refer to the same physical file, access to them will be synchronized.
 *
 * <p>Once the {@code SynchronizedFile} is constructed, the client can read or write to the file as
 * follows.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * boolean fileExists = synchronizedFile.read(file -> file.exists());
 * boolean result = synchronizedFile.write(file -> { Files.touch(file); return true; });
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Multiple threads/processes can read the same file at the same time. However, once a
 * thread/process starts writing to the file, the other threads/processes will block. This behavior
 * is similar to a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock}.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, this class provides the {@link #createIfAbsent(ExceptionConsumer)} method for
 * the client to atomically create the file if it does not yet exist.
 *
 * <p>Note that we often use the term "process", although the term "JVM" would be more correct since
 * there could exist multiple JVMs in a process.
 *
 * <p>This class is thread-safe.
