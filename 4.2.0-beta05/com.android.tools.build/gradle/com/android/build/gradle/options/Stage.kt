/**
 * The stage of an API or feature in its life cycle.
 *
 * An API or feature has an associated [Option] to allow the users to change the behavior of the
 * Android Gradle plugin. The difference between them is that:
 *   - The [Option] associated with an API is intended to be used in the long term. For example, if
 *     it is a [BooleanOption] (or [OptionalBooleanOption]), one value of the option may be
 *     experimental at first, but eventually both values of the option will be supported.
 *   - The [Option] associated with a feature is intended to be used only in the short term. It can
 *     only be a [BooleanOption] (or [OptionalBooleanOption]). One value of the [BooleanOption] may
 *     be experimental at first to enable the new behavior, but eventually the option will be
 *     removed, either because the feature is fully supported and now enforced, or because the
 *     feature was not / is no longer useful and now removed.
