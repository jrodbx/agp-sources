/**
 * This is the logic for locating CMake needed for gradle build. This logic searches for CMake in
 * a prescribed order and provides diagnostic information, warnings, and errors useful to the user
 * in understanding how CMake was found or why it wasn't found.
 *
 * There are several pieces of information at play here:
 * (1) The optional CMake version specified in build.gradle under externalNativeBuild.cmake.version.
 * (2) The optional path to CMake folder specified in local.properties file. This file is not meant
 *     to be checked in to version control.
 * (3) The SDK versions that are available in the SDK. Some of these may have been downloaded
 *     already.
 * (4) The system $PATH variable.
 * (5) The version numbers of "fork CMake" which is an older forked version of CMake that has
 *     additional functionality to help with emitting metadata.
 *
 * The version numbers of SDK CMakes are special in that there are two distinct versions for each
 * cmake.exe:
 * (1) A version like "3.6.0-rc2" which is the compiled-in version that is emitted by a call to
 *     cmake --version.
 * (2) A version like "3.6.4111459" which is the SDK's version for the CMake package. In this case,
 *     4111459 is the ADRT "bid" number used for deployment within SDK.
 *
 * The searching algorithm needs to take into account that new SDK versions of CMake will be added
 * in the future. We can't assume we know versions a priori.
 *
 * Only the following CMake versions are supported:
 * (1) A known "fork CMake" from the SDK
 * (2) A version of CMake that supports CMake "server" mode. This mode is supported by CMake 3.7.0
 *     and higher.
 *
 * The search algorithm tries to enforce several invariants:
 * (1) If a cmake is specified in local.properties then that CMake must be used or it's an error.
 * (2) If a CMake version *is* specified in build.gradle externalNativeBuild.cmake.version then
 *     that version must be matched or it's an error.
 * (3) If a CMake version *is not* specified in build.gradle externalNativeBuild.cmake.version then
 *     fork CMake must be used. We won't use a random CMake found on the path.
 * (4) Combining (2) and (3) creates the additional invariant that there is always a specific CMake
 *     version prescribed by a build.gradle. In the case there is no concrete version in
 *     build.gradle there is still a concreted Android Gradle Plugin version which, in turn,
 *     prescribes an exact CMake version.
 *
 * Given these invariants, the algorithm looks in the following locations:
 * (1) SDK
 * (2) $PATH
 * (3) cmake.dir from local.properties
 *
 * Version matching:
 * An incomplete version like "3.12" is allowed in build.gradle. In this case, the version of the
 * found CMake must exactly match what is specified in build.gradle. This means, for example,
 * if build.gradle specifies 3.12 and only version 3.13 is found then 3.13 WON'T be used. User may
 * specify "3" if they want to match the highest version among 3.*.
 *
 * User may also append a "+" to the version. In this case, the highest version is accepted.
 *
 * If multiple are found in PATH then only the first CMake is considered for use.
 *
 * Error Handling:
 * A lot of the logic in this algorithm is dedicated toward giving good error messages in the case
 * that CMake can't be found.
 *
 * - If some CMake versions are found but they don't match the required version then the user is
 *   told what the versions of those CMakes are and where they were found.
 *
 * - If a requested CMake version looks like an SDK version (because it has a bid number in it) then
 *   a specifically constructed error message is emitted that Android Studio can use to
 *   automatically download that version.
 *
 * The various expected error messages are heavily tested in CmakeLocatorTests.kt.
 *
 * Warning:
 * Right now there is only one warning that may be emitted by this algorithm. This is in the case
 * that a CMake.exe is found but it cannot be executed to get its version number. The reason
 * it's not an error is that a matching CMake version may be found in another location. The reason
 * it's not a diagnostic info is that it's an unusual circumstance and the user may end up
 * confused when their expected CMake isn't found.
