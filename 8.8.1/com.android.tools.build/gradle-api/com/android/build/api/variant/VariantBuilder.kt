/**
 * Model for variant components that only contains configuration-time properties that impacts the
 * build flow.
 *
 * Variant components are the main output of the plugin (e.g. APKs, AARs). They contain references
 * to optional secondary components (tests, fixtures). Their presence can be controlled in select
 * subtypes of [VariantBuilder].
 *
 * It is the object passed to the [AndroidComponentsExtension.beforeVariants] method, like this:
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * androidComponents {
 *   beforeVariants(selector().all()) { variant: VariantBuilder ->
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Note that depending on the actual implementation of [AndroidComponentsExtension], the object
 * received may be a subtype. For instance [ApplicationAndroidComponentsExtension.beforeVariants]
 * will pass [ApplicationVariantBuilder] to the lambda.
 *
 * See [here](https://developer.android.com/build/extend-agp#variant-api-artifacts-tasks) for
 * more information
