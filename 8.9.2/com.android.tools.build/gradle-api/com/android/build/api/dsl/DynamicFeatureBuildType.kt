/**
 * Build types define certain properties that Gradle uses when building and packaging your app, and
 * are typically configured for different stages of your development lifecycle.

 * Dynamic features must have exactly the same build types (by name) as the app that
 * includes them, however settings can be different between the application and the dynamic feature.
 * Properties on dynamic feature build types fall in to three categories.
 *
 * * Properties global to the application that affect the build flow, and so must be explicitly set
 *   in the dynamic feature.
 *   For example, whether the build type is debuggable must match the application that includes this
 *   dynamic feature.
 * * Properties global to the application that do not affect the build flow. These are set in the
 *   `com.android.application` project, and are automatically configured on the dynamic feature,
 *   they cannot be set on the dynamic feature.
 *   For example, application ID suffix and signing cannot be configured on the dynamic feature and
 *   are not present on this interface.
 * * Properties that can vary between the app and the dynamic feature.
 *   For example, `resValues` can be used independently from the app in a dynamic feature.
 *
 * See [ApplicationProductFlavor]
