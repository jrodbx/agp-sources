package com.android.build.api.variant

/**
 * Model for components that only contains configuration-time properties that impacts the build
 * flow.
 *
 * Components can be APKs, AARs, test APKs, unit tests, test fixtures, ...
 *
 * This is the parent interface for all objects that can be manipulated by
 * [AndroidComponentsExtension.beforeVariants]
 *
 * This type is here to mirror the [Component]/[Variant] hierarchy, which also includes
 * [TestComponent] (which is not a [Variant]). In this hierarchy however, there isn't a
 * `TestComponentBuilder` and therefore all objects of this type are also [VariantBuilder]
 *
 * See [VariantBuilder] for more information on accessing instances of this type.
 *
 * The properties exposed by this object have an impact on the build flow. They can add or remove
 * tasks, and change how the tasks consume each other's output. Because of this, they are
 * not using Gradle's [org.gradle.api.provider.Property] so that they can be queried during
 * configuration. Because other applied plugins can change these values in their [beforeVariants]
 * block, it is not safe to read these values in this stage.
 *
 * This object should only be used to set new values. To read the final values of these properties,
 * find the matching property in [Component], and its subtypes
 *
 * See [here](https://developer.android.com/build/extend-agp#variant-api-artifacts-tasks) for
 * more information
