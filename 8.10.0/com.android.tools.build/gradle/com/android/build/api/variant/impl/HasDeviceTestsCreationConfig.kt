     * This method will most likely be promoted to public APIs soon once we figure out a good

     *
     * Right now, each [DeviceTest] being a [com.android.build.api.variant.Component] and therefore
     * has a [com.android.build.api.variant.ComponentIdentity]. This identity has a
     * [com.android.build.api.variant.ComponentIdentity.name] which is composed of the Variant's
     * name and test type. So a `blueDebug` variant's android test Component will be named
     * `blueDebugAndroidTest`. This is due because all the Components must have a unique name within
     * the project.
     *
     * With this API, the [HasDeviceTests] instance (this) is the Variant object, so when we call
     * [deviceTests], the list is already bounded by the Variant instance it is coming from. So
     * naming could be simplified from `blueDebugAndroidTest` to just 'androidTest' or 'AndroidTest',
     * basically using the [ComponentTypeImpl.suffix].
     *
     * Obviously, we will eventually add a 'add' method which will create new instances of
     * [DeviceTest] which will require a unique name within the variant scope, so that part has to
     * be figured out at the same time.
