/**
 * Represents a [Collection] of [BuiltArtifact] produced by a [org.gradle.api.Task].
 *
 * Tasks in Android Gradle Plugin can produce more than one file in the output folder so any
 * [Artifact] with a [Artifact.kind] of type
 * [com.android.build.api.artifact.ArtifactKind.DIRECTORY] can actually contain several produced
 * [File]. For instance, when dealing with multi-apk, there will be several manifest files or APKs
 * produced by the Android Gradle Plugin.
 *
 * Each produced file can be identified with unique metadata like the list of filters and/or
 * version code or version name. This instance will allow producer and consumer
 * [org.gradle.api.Task]s to easily match produced files with this metadata without relying on
 * name mangling or other custom solutions.
 *
 * Simple use of this facility can look like :
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * abstract class MyTask @inject constructor(val objectFactory: ObjectFactory): DefaultTask() {
 *     @get:InputDirectory
 *     abstract val input: DirectoryProperty
 *     @get:OutputDirectory
 *     abstract val output: DirectoryProperty
 *     @get:Internal
 *     abstract val artifactsLoader: Property<BuiltArtifactsLoader>
 *
 *     @TaskAction
 *     fun taskAction() {
 *          val builtArtifacts= artifactsLoader.get().load(
 *               objectFactory, input.get())
 *
 *          TODO : TBD what will be surfaced here
 *
 *          newBuiltArtifacts.save(output.get()))
 *     }
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * This [BuiltArtifacts] will abstract access to these produced files and provided some metadata
 * associated with each file to be able to identify filters, version code or version name.
