/**
 * Access to the artifacts on a Variant object.
 *
 * Artifacts are temporary or final files or directories that are produced by the Android Gradle
 * plugin during the build. Depending on its configuration, each [com.android.build.api.variant.VariantBuilder]
 * produces different versions of some of the output artifacts.
 *
 * An example of temporary artifacts are .class files obtained from compiling source files that will
 * eventually get transformed further into dex files. Final artifacts are APKs and bundle files that
 * are not transformed further.
 *
 * Artifacts are uniquely defined by their [Artifact] type and public artifact types that can be
 * accessed from third-party plugins or build script are defined in [SingleArtifact]
