    /**
     * Specifies a sorted list of build types that the plugin should try to use when a direct

     *
     *
     * Android plugin 3.0.0 and higher try to match each variant of your module with the same one
     * from its dependencies. For example, when you build a "freeDebug" version of your app, the
     * plugin tries to match it with "freeDebug" versions of the local library modules the app
     * depends on.
     *
     *
     * However, there may be situations in which **your app includes build types that a
     * dependency does not**. For example, consider if your app includes a "stage" build type, but
     * a dependency includes only a "debug" and "release" build type. When the plugin tries to build
     * the "stage" version of your app, it won't know which version of the dependency to use, and
     * you'll see an error message similar to the following:
     *
     * ```
     * Error:Failed to resolve: Could not resolve project :mylibrary.
     * Required by:
     * project :app

     * // In the app's build.gradle file.
     * android {
     *     buildTypes {
     *         release {
     *             // Because the dependency already includes a "release" build type,
     *             // you don't need to provide a list of fallbacks here.
     *         }
     *         stage {
     *             // Specifies a sorted list of fallback build types that the
     *             // plugin should try to use when a dependency does not include a
     *             // "stage" build type. You may specify as many fallbacks as you
     *             // like, and the plugin selects the first build type that's
     *             // available in the dependency.
     *             matchingFallbacks = ['debug', 'qa', 'release']
     *         }
     *     }
     * }
     * ```
     *
     *
     * Note that there is no issue when a library dependency includes a build type that your app
     * does not. That's because the plugin simply never requests that build type from the
     * dependency.
