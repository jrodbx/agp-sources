/**
 * Model for components that only contains build-time properties
 *
 * Components can be APKs, AARs, test APKs, unit tests, test fixtures, ...
 *
 * This is the parent interface for all components. From there, there is a first fork, via
 * [Variant] which are production build output (APKs, AARs), and [TestComponent] that are test
 * components. [TestFixtures] is another separate component. See these types for more information.
 *
 * See [Variant] for more information on accessing instances of this type.
 *
 * The properties exposed by this object do not impact the build flow. They are directly set on
 * tasks via [org.gradle.api.provider.Property] linking.
 *
 * For example:
 * ```kotlin
 * tasks.register(...) {
 *   input.set(myComponent.someProperty)
 * * }
 * ```
 *
 * Because links between [org.gradle.api.provider.Property] objects are lazy, they are ordering-safe
 * and any plugins can set new values or link them into their own tasks in any order.
 *
 * However, calling [org.gradle.api.provider.Property.get] during configuration on these properties
 * is not safe as the values could be linked to task output (that requires the task to run).
 *
 * The object also exposes read-only version of the properties exposed by [ComponentBuilder]. These
 * will contain the final values set after all [AndroidComponentsExtension.beforeVariants] callbacks
 * have been executed. It is safe to read these values during configuration time.
 *
 * See [here](https://developer.android.com/build/extend-agp#variant-api-artifacts-tasks) for
 * more information
