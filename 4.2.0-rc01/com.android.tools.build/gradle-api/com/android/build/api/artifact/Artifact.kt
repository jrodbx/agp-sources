/**
 * Defines a type of artifact handled by the Android Gradle Plugin.
 *
 * Each instance of [Artifact] is produced by a [org.gradle.api.Task] and potentially consumed by
 * any number of tasks.
 *
 * An artifact can potentially be produced by more than one task (each task acting in an additive
 * behavior), but consumers must be aware when more than one artifact can be present,
 * implementing the [MultipleArtifact] interface will indicate such requirement.
 *
 * An artifact must be one of the supported [ArtifactKind] and must be provided when the constructor is called.
 * ArtifactKind also defines the specific [FileSystemLocation] subclass used.
