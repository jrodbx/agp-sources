     * To reduce the size of your APK, consider
     * [configuring multiple APKs based on ABI](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/configure-apk-splits.html#configure-abi-split)â€”instead of creating one large APK with all
     * versions of your native libraries, Gradle creates a separate APK for each ABI you want to
     * support and only packages the files each ABI needs.
